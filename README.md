WorthUnzip is an innovative Kotlin-based mobile application designed to empower users with an efficient and secure platform for managing their personal and financial assets. The app features a well-structured dashboard that categorizes assets into Physical and Digital sections, ensuring a seamless experience for tracking, organizing, and maintaining asset information.

     The Physical Assets module enables users to manage details of real estate, gold investments, and bonds. For real estate, users can record the purchase price, transaction date, address, and relevant documents, along with contact details of relationship managers. The gold module allows users to track the weight (in grams) and price per gram, while the bonds module includes fields for the bond name, issuer, investment amount, interest rate, and tenure.

     The Digital Assets module offers tools to monitor financial investments such as stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. Users can also organize bank account details, including account numbers, balances, and IFSC codes, and keep track of insurance policies by documenting policy numbers, premiums, and providers. Each section is equipped with options to save information locally and download statements for offline records.
